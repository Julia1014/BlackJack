# BlackJack Recreation
In this python project, I recreate BlackJack using multiple classes, list comprehensions, and many more techniques to recreate a player's hand, deck, shuffles, and ultimately simulate a game of BlackJack when played. The trickiest part of this project was making sure the individual classes all worked together in the end to create an unbugged game of BlackJack.
